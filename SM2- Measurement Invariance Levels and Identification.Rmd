| |Loadings | Intercepts | Uniqueness | Identification | Notes |
|-----|-----|------|-----|------|-----|
| Configural | Free | Free | Free | Set $\alpha = 0$ and $\psi = 1$ in both groups | | 
| Metric | Constrained | Free | Free | Set $\alpha = 0$ in both groups, set $\psi = 1$ in group 1 and estimate $\psi$ freely in group 2 | | 
| Scalar | Constrained | Constrained | Free |Set $\alpha = 0$ and $\psi = 1$ in group 1, estimate $\alpha$, $\psi$ freely in group 2 | Free the intercepts where loadings were freed| 
| Strict | Constrained | Constrained | Constrained | Same as scalar | Any or all $\theta$ can be freed|
